# About CSS Units

There are several CSS units of length. The most common one is pixels, each corresponding to an individual pixel on the monitor. By default, paragraphs are sized as 16px. <br>
It is not recommended to use absolute values, eg px, for font sizes since it will not capture user browser's preferences. These preferences are found on the settings page of the browser. <br>
Absolute length units come in handy in instances such as when styling the border of an element.
