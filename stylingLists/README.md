# About List Styling

## What are some of the CSS properties that can be used with lists?

> - list-style and list-style-type
> - list-style-position
> - list-style-image

## Take Home Points from the practise

> - The list HTML tag has the following attributes:
>> - start -> This tells the list which number to start counting and labelling the list at.
>> - reversed -> This reverses the list order and starts labelling them from the largest value to the lowest.

> - The li HTML tag can take the attribute `value`

> - Changing color property changes the color of the list markers as well.
> - You can use the pseudo element ::marker to style the labels. Add the property content to this pseudo element and set custom labels
