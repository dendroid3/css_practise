# About CSS Colors
---

You can add colors using either

> - Color name.
> - RGB (Red, Green, Blue), all colors have a max value of 255
> - RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha Value), same as RGB except the Alpha shows transarency/opacity with a value between 0 and 1 with 0 being completely transparent and 1 would be similar to not having the alpha value at all.
> - Hex Colors **(#XXXXXX)** Red, Green, Blue for each 2 consecutive values respectively -> If the value of the pairs match, then one can write one value to rerewsent both.
> - HSL (Hue, Saturation and Lightness), Values of HSL are given in percentage. EG. HSL(20%, 50% 100%)
> - HSLA (Hue, Saturation, Lightness and Alpha Value), the alpha value functions similarly as it does in RGBA

## Color Tools for CSS
>> - Color Pallet Picking Tool [Coolors] (https://coolors.co/ "Coolers Website")
>> - Contrast Checker found on [WebAIM(Web_Accessibility_In_Mind")] (https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ "Contrast Checker")
>> - A better Contrast Checker may still be found on [Coolors] (https://coolors.co/ "Coolers Website")

### Basics of the Contrast Checker Tool
The Contrast Checker Tool provides a contrast ratio between the background and foreground colors. <br>
The Contrast Ratio is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness of the display. <br>
A higher contrast ratio is preferred since is provides better images/readability/legibility! <br>
Typically, Black VS White have the highest Contrast Ratio valued at 21:1 by the Checker <br>
A ratio of more than 4.5:1 is recommended for large text, and 7.1:1 for small text!
